# InternBridge

InternBridge is a platform that facilitates internships by connecting students and recent graduates with employers. The application allows users to create accounts, upload resumes, apply for internships, and receive notifications for new job postings. Employers can post internship opportunities and view applications. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with additional features like Socket.IO for real-time notifications.
